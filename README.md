# guestwall
An application to keep a digital guest wall of everybody who enters your space.

# what is it?
This is a directory that contains a flask server, a couple html documents, a csv, and a subdirectory of images -- it's pretty simple. The idea is to recreate a classic polaroid guest wall, digitally. It is hosted locally, and only people on your network have access. The names and captions are stored in the csv, and the images are stored in the subdirectory.

# how to use it
First, download this folder. In order to run the flask server, make sure you have python and flask installed. Then, simply run ```python server.py``` inside of the directory, and it should be ready to use.
